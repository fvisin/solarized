# Xresources Color Scheme

Use of color schemes with X Windows is heavily dependent upon one's local
configuration. Please see the fine [Arch Linux
wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xresources) for guidance on the use
of .Xresources and related files.

Further information on the .Xresources file and its place in the X Window
System can of course be found on
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_resources).
